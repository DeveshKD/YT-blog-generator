      "\n",
      "Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night in a panic, wondering how to extract a polygonal mesh of an ISO surface from a three-dimensional discrete scalar field? No? Well, I didn't think so. But back in '87, two programmers at General Electric did. They created and patented the marching cubes algorithm, an algorithm that has likely saved countless lives by allowing doctors to visualize data from CT and MRI scans. So, when you're lying on a table getting scanned, you can thank those two for making sure your data looks like a masterpiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you instruct a machine to solve a problem with code, you're creating an algorithm. It's like giving your computer a recipe for rearranging ones and zeros so that it can make animals talk and vacuums walk. Most algorithms belong in the dumpster, but some are fast, some are beautiful, and some are so weird they're indistinguishable from magic. Today, we’ll look at 10 of the most interesting algorithms ever engineered and how they're used to solve very interesting problems in the real world.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Wave Function Collapse\n",
      "\n",
      "First up, wave function collapse—one of the weirdest things in all of science. This concept stems from the double-slit experiment, where particles behave like waves when you're not looking, but when you look, they suddenly collapse down to particles. It makes total sense when you realize we're living in a simulation and the universe wrote this algorithm to cut down on its AWS bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general idea behind wave function collapse can also be implemented programmatically. Imagine you have a map for a video game that needs to go on forever. Instead of making a bigger map, you need an algorithm to procedurally generate it on the fly. Here’s the weird part: We can take this initial map and think of it as being in the initial superposition of all possibilities. Upon observation, it collapses into a particle—or in this case, selects a random map tile while following a consistent set of rules. It provides a random yet cohesive result, and it doesn’t rely on any sort of modern generative AI. This algorithm is like a game of \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" that always picks the most interesting path.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Diffusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of which, AI is weird as hell. The diffusion algorithm, originally developed at OpenAI, is the magic behind image generators like DALL·E and Stable Diffusion. The concept of diffusion actually comes from thermodynamics, where particles spread from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration. In AI, the process is reversed. The algorithm starts by generating random noise (high entropy) and gradually refines it to a structured image (low entropy). \n",
      "\n",
      "First, you need to train a model that can do this well. The diffusion algorithm works in two phases. In the forward phase, it gradually adds noise to an image until it becomes completely random. In the second phase, the algorithm reverses this process, reconstructing the image back into a coherent form. When it runs over millions of labeled images, you get a collection of weights that can generate new images out of thin air, allowing you to build an infinite army of onlyFans models. It’s highly compute-intensive, but it also works well on audio, and the next frontier is diffusion for video generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Simulated Annealing\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, one frustrating thing about programming is that for many problems, there’s not just one solution but many. It’s like trying to organize Amazon’s warehouse: There are many ways to do it, but some are more efficient than others. Simulated annealing is a word that comes from metallurgy, where metals are heated and cooled down over and over again to remove defects. The same idea is used in optimization algorithms to find the best answer in a sea of good answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine trying to find the highest point in a mountain range full of peaks and valleys. A simple hill-climbing algorithm won’t work because there are many local peaks. Initially, the temperature starts high, allowing the algorithm to explore freely. As time goes on, the temperature lowers, decreasing the probability of accepting a worse solution. The trade-off here is exploration versus exploitation. But here’s the funny part: This algorithm is also a good way for beginners to learn how to code. Initially, you start exploring all kinds of different technologies and frameworks, then eventually you find one specific area to specialize in.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Sleep Sort\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of sorting, the most ingenious sorting algorithm of all time is, without a doubt, sleep sort. Most sorting algorithms use strategies like divide and conquer to break up an array into subarrays where it can be sorted more efficiently. But some random genius on the internet found a better way—by delegating the sorting to the CPU scheduler. The code in Bash is incredibly simple: It loops over the array, and for each element, it opens up a new thread that sleeps for the amount of time proportional to the value of its element. Finally, after waking up, it prints that element. It’s genius because it delegates sorting to the CPU scheduler, but it’s also incredibly dumb and useless because it delegates sorting to the CPU scheduler.\n",
      "\n",
      "## BOGO Sort and Quantum BOGO Sort\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of useless sorting algorithms, what about BOGO sort? It tries to sort an array by randomly guessing over and over again. It’s like playing the lottery, but what if we apply the same algorithm with quantum mechanics to the multiverse? If we trust multiverse science, we know that all possible outcomes exist in separate parallel universes. That means if you find yourself with an unsorted array, there's some other parallel universe where it is sorted. With a portal gun, you could travel to that universe and steal the sorted array. Although you'd have to kill the version of yourself in that universe. If it’s a really large array, quantum BOGO sort might be worth it. But, let's be real, it's purely hypothetical.\n",
      "\n",
      "## RSA and Shor's Algorithm\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most practical and godlike algorithms of all time is RSA, a public key crypto system. It’s essential for digital security, allowing people on the internet to lock their mailboxes and sign their letters with a unique signature. RSA is based on one simple mathematical reality: Multiplying large numbers to find two original large prime numbers is extremely difficult and time-consuming. (Your laptop would take 300 trillion years to brew coffee, unless quantum computers become a thing and we can start leveraging Shor's algorithm, which can solve the integer factorization problem exponentially faster than any classical algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime factoring is pretty simple, but how Shor's algorithm does it is where things get weird. It relies on concepts like qubits, superposition, and entanglement to perform massive amounts of calculations in parallel. The algorithm is legit, but so far, the biggest number ever factored is 21. Even IBM's state-of-the-art Q System One fails when trying to factor the number 35. However, recently the Chinese factored a bigger number with a quantum computer using a different algorithm that doesn't scale well for large numbers unlike Shor's algorithm. So, everything is safe for now, but when someone figures out how to make quantum computers work, all hell could break loose in the cybersecurity world.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Marching Cubes Algorithm\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of this video, I mentioned the marching cubes algorithm, but it deserves a closer look. It starts with a 3D scalar field, which might represent data from an MRI machine. Each point in 3D space is represented by a single number (scalar). The algorithm starts with a single point and takes its eight neighboring locations to form an imaginary cube. It treats the values as bits in an 8-bit integer, resulting in 256 different possibilities that point to a pre-calculated array of polygons. The algorithm marches through each point to create a 3D mesh that can be used in 3D software. Back then, it was really cool because MRI machines produce slices of data that can now be rendered in 3D. In modern times, we're often dealing with distributed systems in the cloud, which brings us to the Byzantine generals problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Byzantine Generals Problem\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you're a general in the Byzantine Army. You're camped around a city with a few other generals, and you plan to attack at dawn. But what if one of the generals gets drunk and wakes up hungover and can't attack? The entire system could collapse. Computers have the same problem. Sometimes they might fail or be infiltrated by hackers, and you never know when or where that's going to happen. Luckily, algorithms like PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) are designed to solve this problem, keeping a distributed network working properly even if up to one-third of its nodes go haywire. It works by having a node broadcast a pre-prepare message to other nodes, indicating its readiness to execute some code that will change the system. Once a consensus is formed, the original node sends back a commit message to all the other nodes, which can then execute the changes, making the entire state of the system consistent. These algorithms are essential for blockchain technology and distributed cloud databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Boids\n",
      "\n",
      "What's really cool about algorithms is that they can also reflect nature. Consider Craig Reynolds' Boids program, which was created back in '86 and simulates the flocking behavior of birds. What’s so cool about it is that it demonstrates the emerging complexity or beauty that we get out of just a few simple rules. In this case, the birds have three rules: They steer to avoid crowding, they steer towards the average heading of the flock, and they steer towards the center of mass of their local flock mates. The end result is these intricate patterns that weren’t programmed directly but emerged naturally. It’s like making a cake and finding a unicorn on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Boyer-Moore String Search\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, that brings us to an old algorithm that blew my mind just the other day and inspired this video: the Boyer-Moore string search. It’s weird because it becomes faster and more efficient as the string it’s searching becomes bigger. It makes sense when you understand the algorithm. It scans text from right to left and has two rules: When it encounters a bad character not found in the search pattern, it jumps past it based on an estimation made in a pre-processed table. Likewise, if it finds a partial match but a mismatch occurs, it has a separate pre-calculated table that maximizes the number of characters it can safely skip. These rules are called heuristics, which are like functions that aren’t guaranteed to be perfect but are far more practical than looping over every single character. If you've ever wondered why `grep` is so fast, you have this algorithm to thank.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the next time you're staring at a screen trying to figure out how to sort a list or generate a map, remember these algorithms. They're not just lines of code—they're the backbone of our digital world, from quantum computing to video game maps, and they're making our lives a lot easier (and a lot more interesting).\n"

      "\n",
      "The general idea behind wave function collapse can also be implemented programmatically. Imagine you have a map for a video game that needs to go on forever. Instead of making a bigger map, you need an algorithm to procedurally generate it on the fly. Here’s the weird part: We can take this initial map and think of it as being in the initial superposition of all possibilities. Upon observation, it collapses into a particle—or in this case, selects a random map tile while following a consistent set of rules. It provides a random yet cohesive result, and it doesn’t rely on any sort of modern generative AI. This algorithm is like a game of \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" that always picks the most interesting path.\n",

      "## Diffusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of which, AI is weird as hell. The diffusion algorithm, originally developed at OpenAI, is the magic behind image generators like DALL·E and Stable Diffusion. The concept of diffusion actually comes from thermodynamics, where particles spread from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration. In AI, the process is reversed. The algorithm starts by generating random noise (high entropy) and gradually refines it to a structured image (low entropy). \n",
      "\n",
      "First, you need to train a model that can do this well. The diffusion algorithm works in two phases. In the forward phase, it gradually adds noise to an image until it becomes completely random. In the second phase, the algorithm reverses this process, reconstructing the image back into a coherent form. When it runs over millions of labeled images, you get a collection of weights that can generate new images out of thin air, allowing you to build an infinite army of onlyFans models. It’s highly compute-intensive, but it also works well on audio, and the next frontier is diffusion for video generation.\n",

      "## Simulated Annealing\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, one frustrating thing about programming is that for many problems, there’s not just one solution but many. It’s like trying to organize Amazon’s warehouse: There are many ways to do it, but some are more efficient than others. Simulated annealing is a word that comes from metallurgy, where metals are heated and cooled down over and over again to remove defects. The same idea is used in optimization algorithms to find the best answer in a sea of good answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine trying to find the highest point in a mountain range full of peaks and valleys. A simple hill-climbing algorithm won’t work because there are many local peaks. Initially, the temperature starts high, allowing the algorithm to explore freely. As time goes on, the temperature lowers, decreasing the probability of accepting a worse solution. The trade-off here is exploration versus exploitation. But here’s the funny part: This algorithm is also a good way for beginners to learn how to code. Initially, you start exploring all kinds of different technologies and frameworks, then eventually you find one specific area to specialize in.\n",

      "## Sleep Sort\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of sorting, the most ingenious sorting algorithm of all time is, without a doubt, sleep sort. Most sorting algorithms use strategies like divide and conquer to break up an array into subarrays where it can be sorted more efficiently. But some random genius on the internet found a better way—by delegating the sorting to the CPU scheduler. The code in Bash is incredibly simple: It loops over the array, and for each element, it opens up a new thread that sleeps for the amount of time proportional to the value of its element. Finally, after waking up, it prints that element. It’s genius because it delegates sorting to the CPU scheduler, but it’s also incredibly dumb and useless because it delegates sorting to the CPU scheduler.\n",

      "## BOGO Sort and Quantum BOGO Sort\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of useless sorting algorithms, what about BOGO sort? It tries to sort an array by randomly guessing over and over again. It’s like playing the lottery, but what if we apply the same algorithm with quantum mechanics to the multiverse? If we trust multiverse science, we know that all possible outcomes exist in separate parallel universes. That means if you find yourself with an unsorted array, there's some other parallel universe where it is sorted. With a portal gun, you could travel to that universe and steal the sorted array. Although you'd have to kill the version of yourself in that universe. If it’s a really large array, quantum BOGO sort might be worth it. But, let's be real, it's purely hypothetical.\n",

      "One of the most practical and godlike algorithms of all time is RSA, a public key crypto system. It’s essential for digital security, allowing people on the internet to lock their mailboxes and sign their letters with a unique signature. RSA is based on one simple mathematical reality: Multiplying large numbers to find two original large prime numbers is extremely difficult and time-consuming. (Your laptop would take 300 trillion years to brew coffee, unless quantum computers become a thing and we can start leveraging Shor's algorithm, which can solve the integer factorization problem exponentially faster than any classical algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime factoring is pretty simple, but how Shor's algorithm does it is where things get weird. It relies on concepts like qubits, superposition, and entanglement to perform massive amounts of calculations in parallel. The algorithm is legit, but so far, the biggest number ever factored is 21. Even IBM's state-of-the-art Q System One fails when trying to factor the number 35. However, recently the Chinese factored a bigger number with a quantum computer using a different algorithm that doesn't scale well for large numbers unlike Shor's algorithm. So, everything is safe for now, but when someone figures out how to make quantum computers work, all hell could break loose in the cybersecurity world.\n",

      "At the beginning of this video, I mentioned the marching cubes algorithm, but it deserves a closer look. It starts with a 3D scalar field, which might represent data from an MRI machine. Each point in 3D space is represented by a single number (scalar). The algorithm starts with a single point and takes its eight neighboring locations to form an imaginary cube. It treats the values as bits in an 8-bit integer, resulting in 256 different possibilities that point to a pre-calculated array of polygons. The algorithm marches through each point to create a 3D mesh that can be used in 3D software. Back then, it was really cool because MRI machines produce slices of data that can now be rendered in 3D. In modern times, we're often dealing with distributed systems in the cloud, which brings us to the Byzantine generals problem.\n",

But what if one of the generals gets drunk and wakes up hungover and can't attack? The entire system could collapse. Computers have the same problem. Sometimes they might fail or be infiltrated by hackers, and you never know when or where that's going to happen. Luckily, algorithms like PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) are designed to solve this problem, keeping a distributed network working properly even if up to one-third of its nodes go haywire. It works by having a node broadcast a pre-prepare message to other nodes, indicating its readiness to execute some code that will change the system. Once a consensus is formed, the original node sends back a commit message to all the other nodes, which can then execute the changes, making the entire state of the system consistent. These algorithms are essential for blockchain technology and distributed cloud databases.\n",

What’s so cool about it is that it demonstrates the emerging complexity or beauty that we get out of just a few simple rules. In this case, the birds have three rules: They steer to avoid crowding, they steer towards the average heading of the flock, and they steer towards the center of mass of their local flock mates. The end result is these intricate patterns that weren’t programmed directly but emerged naturally. It’s like making a cake and finding a unicorn on top.\n",

It’s weird because it becomes faster and more efficient as the string it’s searching becomes bigger. It makes sense when you understand the algorithm. It scans text from right to left and has two rules: When it encounters a bad character not found in the search pattern, it jumps past it based on an estimation made in a pre-processed table. Likewise, if it finds a partial match but a mismatch occurs, it has a separate pre-calculated table that maximizes the number of characters it can safely skip. These rules are called heuristics, which are like functions that aren’t guaranteed to be perfect but are far more practical than looping over every single character. If you've ever wondered why `grep` is so fast, you have this algorithm to thank.\n",

No? Well, I didn\\'t think so. But back in \\'87, two programmers at General Electric did. They created and patented the marching cubes algorithm, an algorithm that has likely saved countless lives by allowing doctors to visualize data from CT and MRI scans. So, when you\\'re lying on a table getting scanned, you can thank those two for making sure your data looks like a masterpiece.\\n\\nWhen you instruct a machine to solve a problem with code, you\\'re creating an algorithm. It\\'s like giving your computer a recipe for rearranging ones and zeros so that it can make animals talk and vacuums walk. Most algorithms belong in the dumpster, but some are fast, some are beautiful, and some are so weird they\\'re indistinguishable from magic. Today, we’ll look at 10 of the most interesting algorithms ever engineered and how they\\'re used to solve very interesting problems in the real world.\\n\\n## Wave Function Collapse\\n\\nFirst up, wave function collapse—one of the weirdest things in all of science.
